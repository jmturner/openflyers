********************************************************************************
First install:

- To install OpenFlyers, unzip all files into the chosen directory.

- Make connect.php and config.php files writable just for the install time being

- Then with a browser go to the install/index.php.

- If you got some alert about PEAR packages, it's because they are not reconized
by OpenFlyers. It may have two origins: 

 *there if no PEAR on your host
 *your host got PEAR but not the packages required by OpenFlyers

In the first case, you can solve the trouble by installing PEAR and the required
packages in some directory. Then, you have to alter the value of the
PEAR_DIRECTORY constant contained in the conf/config.php. Thus, OpenFlyers will
know where finding PEAR files.
To know the path, you may create a short php file with the following content:
<?php echo dirname($_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME']);?>
To find the PEAR files, you got several methods. They are described in the
readme.txt file of the pearPool pack available on download.

In the second case, you got two ways:
 *either you got a shell access to your host and you can follow the recommandations
  writen in the readme.txt form the pearPool package
 *either you haven't got a shell access to your host and in this case it's more
  simple to deal like in the first case.

- Type the required informations, then valid.

- Now, you can connect yourself with the following login/password: admin/admin

- clik on ADMIN in the menu to personalize the default club configuration,
add some profiles and users.

ATTENTION: change IMMEDIATLY the password of the admin user!
We advise you to create as soon as possible a new user with the same profile and
to delete the admin user created by default so to secure the system.
Do not forget to delete the SQL and install directory.

Update an older release:

IMPORTANT : Begin with a safety backup of your database. Thus, you will be able
to restore your database in case of update failure.

Replace all current files by newer ones contained in the last released zip. You
can also keep files located in the conf directory so it will be not necessary to
write down database access parameters again.
Go with your browser to the page install/index.php. Database will be upgrade and
your older informations will be preserved.

In case of trouble, ask your questions throw the forums: http://openflyers.org
